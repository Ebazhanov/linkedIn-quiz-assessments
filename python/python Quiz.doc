Q1. What is an abstract class?
 An abstract class is the name for any class from which you can instantiate an object.
 Abstract classes must be redefined any time an object is instantiated from them.
 Abstract classes must inherit from concrete classes.
 An abstract class exists only so that other “concrete” classes can inherit from the abstract class.
Q2. What happens when you use the build-in function any() on a list?
 The any() function will randomly return any item from the list.
 The any() function returns True if any item in the list evaluates to True. Otherwise, it returns False.
 The any() function takes as arguments the list to check inside, and the item to check for. If “any” of the items in the list match the item to check for, the function returns True.
 The any() function returns a Boolean value that answers the question “Are there any items in this list?”
Example
if any([True, False, False, False]) == True:
    print('Yes, there is True')
>>> Yes, there is True

Q3. What data structure does a binary tree degenerate to if it isn’t balanced properly?
 linked list
 queue
 set
 OrderedDict
Q4. What statement about static methods is true?
 Static methods are called static because they always return None.
 Static methods can be bound to either a class or an instance of a class.
 Static methods serve mostly as utility methods or helper methods, since they can’t access or modify a class’s state.
 Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class.
Q5. What are attributes?
 Attributes are long-form version of an if/else statement, used when testing for equality between objects.
 Attributes are a way to hold data or describe a state for a class or an instance of a class.
 Attributes are strings that describe characteristics of a class.
 Function arguments are called “attributes” in the context of class methods and instance methods.
Explanation Attributes defined under the class, arguments goes under the functions. arguments usually refer as parameter, whereas attributes are the constructor of the class or an instance of a class.
Q6. What is the term to describe this code?
count, fruit, price = (2, 'apple', 3.5)
 tuple assignment
 tuple unpacking
 tuple matching
 tuple duplication
Q7. What built-in list method would you use to remove items from a list?
 .delete() method
 pop(my_list)
 del(my_list)
 .pop() method
Example
my_list = [1,2,3]
my_list.pop(0)
my_list
>>>[2,3]
