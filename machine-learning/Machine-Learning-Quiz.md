#### Q20. Your university wants to use machine learning algorithms to help sort through incoming student applications. An administrator asks if the admissions decisions might be biased against any particular group, such as women. What would be the best answer?

- [ ] Machine learning algorithms are based on math and statistics, and so by definition will be unbiased.
- [ ] There is no way to identify bias in the data.
- [ ] Machine learning algorithms are powerful enough to eliminate bias from the data.
- [x] All human-created data is biased, and data scientists need to account for that.
